# Themes

**If app's appearance doesn't looks right after applying theme, please kill app and re-open it.**

**Also, invalid themes may cause app crash. If that happens you need to connect your phone to computer and delete that theme.**

* See this [link](https://github.com/SpongeBobSun/Prodigal-iOS/blob/master/Theme.md) for how to create & using themes.

# Roadmap

Since APP Store has already approved this APP, I'm going to re-write the media library part, which will centralize media items both from iTunes and local file.

- [x] Refactor Media Library
- [x] Update UI on Android version
- [x] Post bug fix

# Naming in this APP

Yep, I'm a big Futurama fan. Don't be scared if you found `Bender` in my source.

Also, nearly all codes were written while listening to `Kid Rock`'s `Prodigal Son`.
